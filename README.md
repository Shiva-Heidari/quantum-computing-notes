# Quantum Computing Notes with Qiskit

This repository is a collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks documenting my learning journey in quantum computing using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and Python. It includes step-by-step explorations of quantum gates, entanglement, quantum circuits, and pulse-level control.

I’m using this repository to deepen my understanding of quantum information and to support my transition from academic research into quantum industry roles.
