# Quantum Computing Notes with Qiskit

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through quantum computing using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and Python, following the book *Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Qiskit*.

Each notebook contains working code, visualizations, and conceptual explanations of quantum circuits, gates, entanglement, measurement, and more.

## 🔬 Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Bloch.ipynb](./Bloch.ipynb) | Visualizing qubit superposition using Hadamard gates and the Bloch sphere |

## 🚀 Topics Covered (in progress)

- Bloch sphere visualization
- Superposition using Hadamard gate
- Entanglement and Bell states
- Measurement and simulation using `qasm_simulator`
- Quantum circuit drawing and histogram analysis
- (More to come...)
